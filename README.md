# A Computational Approach to Estimating Reconstructive Surgical Need Amidst War in Gaza

## A project by the Duke Bass Connections Team â€“ Meeting the Need for Reconstructive Surgery in Gaza 2024-25

### Overview
This repository contains the code and datasets used to forecast injuries in Gaza during the current conflict. Our aim is to provide a transparent, reproducible model that can help estimate surgical needs both during the ongoing conflict and in its aftermath, recognizing that current infrastructure is severly limited due to the severe destruction. 
  
### Who We Are
We are part of the Duke Bass Connections Team - Meeting the Need for Reconstructive Surgery in Gaza. We are made up of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers, with supervision from academic physicians and faculty who have extensive experience in Middle Eastern conflicts and reconstructive surgery at Duke University, Durham, NC, USA. Any views or statements made herein are our own and do not represent the institution.  

### Why This Project
The ongoing conflict in Gaza has caused extensive Palestinian civilian injuries in a setting where access to specialized reconstructive care was already limited. Damage to hospitals, loss of trained personnel, and disrupted supply chains have compounded these challenges. Recognizing these critical gaps, we aims to develop a computational model that can be used to predict evolving reconstructive surgery needs in Gaza. The future resolution or escalation of the conflict remains unclear, and as such the model is meant to be used to forecast reconstructive burdens based on multiple scenarios of possible conflict evolution.

This project does not seek to assign blame or take a political position. Our focus is entirely humanitarian: to strengthen eveidence-based planning for care delivery under extreme conditioins.

### What We Aim to Do
- Model injury incidence using injury reports, attack characterization, satellite-based infrastructure damage data, and independent news sources/social media. 
- Estimate anticipated reconstructive surgery needs for current and future conflict scenarios
- Offer a transferrable framework adaptable to other conflict or disaster contexts

### Contents
- Python scripts for data processing and modeling
- Example datasets
- Documentation for replicating and adapting the methodology
